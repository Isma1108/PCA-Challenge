A **Pythagorean triple** consists of three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Such a triple is commonly written $(a, b, c)$, a well-known example is (3, 4, 5). 
On the other hand, a **primitive Pythagorean triple** (PPT) is one in which $a$, $b$ and $c$ are coprime (that is, 
they have no common divisor larger than 1). For example, (3, 4, 5) is a primitive Pythagorean triple whereas (6, 8, 10) is not.

The program solves a problem where we are given several N, one per line, and we have to print the total number of primitive 
Pythagorean triplets $(a,b,c)$ that there exists, such that $a < b < c <= N$. The input ends with a line with a 0. The program that solves 
it is made in C and optimized to be executed on a Xilinx Zynq Platform board, with an ARM.
